    <img src="images/kick.gif"height="250">
    My name is Dayne Jensen and I am 16 years old. I have done Tae Kwon Do for about six and a half years, earning my black belt November 2nd, 2017! I unforunately quit a year ago and now I do calisthenics (body weight exercising) for about 4 months now and continue to work harder everyday. I hope to join the Track and Field team in 2020. My favorite subject is math, although I am not doing well in Calc AB. Well, thats all folks. </p>
